# pi3-services
Simple bash scripts allowing you to configure a Raspberry Pi and deploy some services on it.

## Possibilities

* Samba server
* Domain Name Server
* Connect a webcam and access it
* LDAP server
  * Let's be adventurous and connect a SSO service to it! ;)
* FTP server
* VNC server
* Add security mechanisms with tools like ip2ban & Cie.
* [Play with a LED](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/gpio-examples/tux-crossing/gpio-examples-1-a-single-led/). Eventually command the LED trough a simple web interface.
* Emit an uploaded `.wav` file using RDS radio with [PiFM](https://github.com/ChristopheJacquet/PiFmRds).
